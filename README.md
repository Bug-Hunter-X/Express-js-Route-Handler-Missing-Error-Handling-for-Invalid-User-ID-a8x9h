# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the provided code attempts to parse a user ID from the request parameters as an integer without first validating its format.  This can lead to unexpected errors or crashes if the ID is not a valid number.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug
The original code fails to check if `req.params.id` is a valid integer before attempting to parse it. If it's not, `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, and the subsequent `users.find` operation might throw an error or return unexpected results.

## Solution
The solution involves adding input validation to ensure that `req.params.id` is a valid number before proceeding.  This prevents errors caused by unexpected input types.

This example showcases the importance of robust error handling in Express.js applications to ensure stability and prevent unexpected behavior.
